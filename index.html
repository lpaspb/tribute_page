The article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths."He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply. Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa</p>
